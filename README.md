## Install Devstack  
To install Devstack, follow these steps.  
1. Get a local copy of `edx/devstack` repository  
   ```
   cd ~
   mkdir openEDX 
   cd openEDX
   git clone https://github.com/edx/devstack
   cd devstack
   ```  
2. Use make to check out the correct branch  
   `make dev.checkout`  
3. Clone the Open edX service repositories  
   `make dev.clone`  
   Use the command will clone several repos into `~/openEDX` directory  
   > You may encounter the following problem when cloning repositories  
   > <pre>error: RPC failed; curl 18 transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining  
   > fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly  
   > fatal: early EOF  
   > fatal: index-pack failed</pre>  
   > It is the poor network connection with github.com on Aliyun that cause the error.  
   > To solve the error, we need use a proxy: [proxy settings](https://www.jianshu.com/p/b1f6e6944f94)  
4. Deploy the platform  
   `make dev.provision`  
   > Step 3 and Step 4 may take a long time to process, please be patient.  
   > If error happens during steps, please try again.
5. Start service  
   `make dev.up`  
   Then we could get platform service from http://host:18000/ and http://host:18010/ (host is server public ip)
